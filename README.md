Overview<br><br>
This project aims to build a dashboard that aggregates content from social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, using machine learning to personalize recommendations and reduce distractions. Users can view personalized content recommendations, analyze their consumption patterns, and adjust preferences for improved content focus and relevance.<br><br>

Key Features
<ol>
<li>Content Aggregation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fetches content data from APIs of YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms.</li>
    <li>Displays aggregated content feeds in a unified dashboard.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
ML-Powered Recommendations
Analyzes user behavior (e.g., likes, views, bookmarks) to generate personalized content recommendations.
Uses collaborative filtering or content-based filtering models for intelligent suggestions.
Implements NLP techniques for prioritizing content based on topics and keywords of interest.
Dynamic Preference Adjustment

Users can adjust their preferences directly in the dashboard.
The system continuously learns from user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down, skips) to refine recommendations.
Distraction Filtering

Customizable filters to block topics, mute users, or prioritize specific accounts.
Focus modes to hide unrelated content and increase productivity.
Analytics Dashboard

Displays detailed consumption trends (e.g., time spent per platform, favorite topics).
Helps users optimize their content consumption and focus on high-value material.
</ol>

Python: Primary language for implementing ML algorithms and data processing.
Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for models), NLTK, spaCy (for text analysis).
Flask / FastAPI: For serving machine learning models via APIs.
Content Aggregation APIs:
YouTube Data API: To fetch videos, playlists, and user subscriptions.
Twitter API: To fetch tweets, hashtags, and trends.
Instagram Graph API: To fetch user posts, stories, and media.
RSS Feeds: For platforms without formal APIs.
Deployment:
AWS / GCP: Cloud services for hosting the backend, database, and ML models.
Netlify / Vercel: For deploying the frontend.
Process Workflow
User Registration & Login
Users sign up and authenticate via OAuth to link their social media accounts.

Data Aggregation
APIs fetch content data in real-time, storing it in the database. Regular synchronization ensures up-to-date content.

Preference Capture
Users input initial preferences (e.g., topics, accounts) via the settings panel.
The system analyzes past activities to infer implicit preferences.

Recommendation Engine
The system uses collaborative filtering and NLP to provide personalized content.
Filters apply user-defined distractions and preferences.

Dashboard Display
Content is organized in sections (e.g., Videos, Tweets, Posts), and users can interact with it (e.g., like, bookmark).

Analytics
The analytics section visualizes time spent on different platforms, helping users optimize their content consumption habits.
